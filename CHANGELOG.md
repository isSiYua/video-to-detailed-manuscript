# Changelog

## 1.1.0 — deployment packaging

- Adds a dry-run-capable Debian/Ubuntu installer for Hermes, Codex, and explicit Agent Skill directories.
- Installs the CPU runtime and delegates all model preparation to the existing deterministic `prepare-asr` command.
- Documents the exact Paraformer, FSMN-VAD, and CT-Punctuation ModelScope IDs and official model cards.
- Does not change the frozen manuscript, visual, task, or storage pipeline.

## 1.0.0 — first public Bilibili release

This release freezes the Bilibili manuscript pipeline after acceptance testing with multiple real videos.

- Produces structured, detail-preserving edited manuscripts instead of summaries or raw subtitles.
- Uses complete-transcript planning, golden-style writing, detail restoration, and final concise copyediting.
- Reconciles bounded ASR/terminology suspects without turning mechanical checks into the writer.
- Plans visual evidence from transcript semantics, locally detects and deduplicates candidate frames, and limits paid vision calls.
- Converts complete simple text evidence to Markdown while retaining dense prompts, diagrams, paper figures, complex interfaces, and partial OCR as inline images.
- Re-captures retained images from the highest available stream up to the requested 1080p.
- Runs detached background jobs with two-worker queuing, per-task six-stage progress, cancellation, one-shot Feishu ZIP delivery, soft deletion, recovery, and media cleanup.
- Keeps credentials, operational state, Vault content, exports, source media, and model weights outside the repository.

Future source adapters must preserve this release's Bilibili output and reuse the common manuscript core.
