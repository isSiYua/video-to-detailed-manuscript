# Third-party notices

This skill contains focused adaptations inspired by the following MIT-licensed projects. Their full repositories remain the authoritative sources and licenses.

- BiliNote, copyright its contributors: Bilibili subtitle-first acquisition flow and current `dm_img_*` yt-dlp compatibility approach. https://github.com/JefferyHcool/BiliNote
- summarize, copyright its contributors: scene-threshold calibration, average-hash comparison, and frame-quality approach. https://github.com/steipete/summarize
- video-report-nemotron, copyright its contributors: intermediate artifact separation, stable local media, OCR-first visual workflow, and cleanup lifecycle. https://github.com/AetherX-Technologies/video-report-nemotron
- video-to-subtitle-summary-skill, copyright its contributors: optional faster-whisper runtime fallback patterns. https://github.com/imlewc/video-to-subtitle-summary-skill

The optional FunASR runtime is an external dependency and is not redistributed in this Skill archive. The FunASR toolkit is MIT-licensed, while pretrained model weights have separate model-card licenses that must be reviewed before redistribution. https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR

The optional Bilibili AI-conclusion transcript integration follows public field descriptions maintained by the community Bilibili API collection; no source code from that project is copied here. The endpoint requires the user's own authenticated session and may change or be unavailable. https://github.com/pskdje/bilibili-API-collect

Redistribution of adapted MIT-licensed portions is permitted subject to preservation of the applicable copyright and permission notices. Consult each linked repository's `LICENSE` file when redistributing this skill.

VideoLingo (Apache-2.0) was studied for its faithfulness-then-expressiveness workflow and neighbouring-context pattern. No VideoLingo source code is redistributed in this Skill; the independent implementation applies the architectural idea to manuscript editing. https://github.com/Huanshere/VideoLingo
