# Multi-source roadmap

Version 1.0.0 freezes the first public Bilibili manuscript pipeline. New sources should enter through adapters and reuse the same transcript/evidence, editing, visual, task, storage, and export layers. Do not fork the manuscript core for each website.

## Upstream-first development rule

Before implementing or repairing a platform adapter, search maintained open-source implementations and record the candidate's current capability, maintenance status, dependency cost, and license. Prefer a compatible maintained library or a narrow attributed adaptation over new platform scraping code. Reject archived, broken, unlicensed, incompatible-copyleft, unsafe credential, or browser-evasion dependencies. Project-owned code should remain limited to the source contract, SSRF/secret/cost gates, deterministic evidence conversion, golden manuscript pipeline, tasks, and Obsidian output. Re-run this audit when a platform changes rather than accumulating speculative selectors.

## Adapter boundary

Each source adapter should provide the smallest applicable subset of:

- `can_handle(url)` and a canonical URL;
- title, author, publication time, source ID, and access metadata;
- clean text or timed subtitle segments;
- one authorized audio stream when local ASR is required;
- one analysis video stream and a higher-quality retained-frame stream when visuals exist;
- stable source links and evidence timestamps.

The common pipeline converts those results into chronological text evidence and optional visual evidence. Text-only pages skip ASR and frame extraction. Video sources follow the existing subtitle-first order.

## Planned adapters

### YouTube

Implemented for public videos. It uses public metadata and creator-provided subtitle tracks first, then original-language automatically generated captions. It acquires one audio stream only when subtitles are unavailable and obtains video frames only for transcript-requested visual evidence. Restricted server networks may require a privately operated outbound source proxy.

### Generic web pages

Implemented for public HTTP(S) pages. It reuses Apache-2.0 `readability-lxml` for main-article selection and BSD-3-Clause `extruct` for standard JSON-LD metadata, then preserves headings, lists, tables, code, captions, source links, author, and original figures; a deterministic structure-fidelity path is used when Readability would remove a table, code block, or image. Text and figures use an internal document-order locator; the published note never labels it as a video timestamp. Credential-bearing URLs, local/private/reserved network targets, unsupported content types, and oversized responses are rejected. Pages that require login, JavaScript rendering, payment, or risk-control clearance return an explicit limitation. In particular, CSDN may return HTTP 521 or reset a connection on some exits; the adapter does not route through an untrusted third-party reader to conceal that failure.

### Zhihu

Implemented for answer and article URLs through the Apache-2.0 `zhihu-tui` 0.1.3 structured client. Its raw HTML is converted through the common document evidence path so links, inline code, LaTeX, and original figures survive into the four semantic editing passes. The adapter attempts an unauthenticated read first; current local and mainland test exits were both risk-controlled, so the platform menu explains how to provide the user's own `z_c0` through hidden SSH input. It never scans local browsers, embeds a shared Cookie, collects comments, or treats the invite-only official search Access Secret as arbitrary URL/full-content authorization. Paid, deleted, or account-inaccessible content returns an explicit limitation. Zhihu video remains outside this document adapter until an authorized media path is separately reviewed.

### Douyin and Xiaohongshu

Treat these as optional, best-effort adapters because share URLs, dynamic rendering, login requirements, and risk control change frequently. Process only content available through the user's authorized session. Prefer post text and platform captions; download media only when necessary for ASR or indispensable visual evidence.

## One multimodal model

A single image-capable provider/model may already serve both text and vision by assigning the same API key, base URL, and model name to `VTM_LLM_*` and `VTM_VISION_*`. Keep the logical calls separate: manuscript editing and frame inspection need different prompts, token ceilings, retries, caching, and failure handling. This preserves model portability while allowing a future DeepSeek multimodal release to replace the current DeepSeek/Qwen split without redesigning the Skill.

## Release order

1. Freeze and publish the Bilibili core with reproducible tests and no credentials or private artifacts.
2. Add the source-adapter protocol without changing Bilibili output.
3. Implement YouTube and generic web-page adapters with fixture-based regression tests (complete).
4. Add Zhihu answer/article documents (complete).
5. Evaluate Douyin and Xiaohongshu as optional integrations against platform stability and account safety.
